  * @brief High level Programming Interface of the Motor Control SDK
  *
  *  This interface allows for performing basic operations on the motor(s) driven by an
  * Motor Control SDK based application. With it, motors can be started and stopped, speed or
  * torque ramps can be programmed and executed and information on the state of the motors can
  * be retrieved, among others.
  *
  *  This interface consists in functions that target a specific motor, indicated in their name.
  * These functions aims at being the main interface used by an Application to control motors.
  *
  *  The current Motor Control API can cope with up to 2 motors.
