 * This symbols defines the value of 1 Hertz in the unit used by the functions of the API for
 * their speed parameters.
 *
 * For instance, if the chosen unit is the RPM, SPEED_UNIT is defined to 60, since 1 Hz is 60 RPM.
 *
 * @note This symbol should not be set to a literal numeric value. Rather, it should be set to one
